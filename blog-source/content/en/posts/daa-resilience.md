### Standardizing the Detroit Automation Academy Infrastructure

Operational excellence is the foundation of scale. Today, we successfully finalized the **DAA Troubleshooting Guide**, a critical resource for instructors at the **Michigan Central** and **Boys & Girls Clubs** locations.

**Synthesized Improvements:**
- **Dynamic Diagnostics:** Real-time troubleshooting for QR code systems and event dashboards.
- **Portability:** Migrated from external dependencies to robust inline architectures.
- **Agent Coordination:** Integrated technical support protocols into the instructor workflow.

This documentation ensures that our educational activations remain resilient as we expand our footprint in the Detroit automation ecosystem.
