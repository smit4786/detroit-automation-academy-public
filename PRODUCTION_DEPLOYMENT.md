  grep -A 5 "Certificate"
# Expected: Certificate chain with daa-ssl-cert
```

**9:35 AM - Health Checks**

```bash
# Check load balancer health
gcloud compute backend-buckets list | grep daa

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "⚠️  INITIATING ROLLBACK"
BACKUP_DATE=$1  # Format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

if [ -z "$BACKUP_DATE" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
  echo "Recent backups:"
  gsutil ls gs://daa-production-backup/ | tail -5
  exit 1
fi

PROD_BUCKET="gs://daa-production"
BACKUP_PATH="gs://daa-production-backup/pre-deployment-$BACKUP_DATE"

echo "Rolling back to $BACKUP_DATE..."

# Step 1: Restore from backup
echo "  • Restoring files from backup..."
gsutil -m cp -r "$BACKUP_PATH/*" "$PROD_BUCKET/"
echo "    ✓ Files restored"

# Step 2: Purge CDN cache
echo "  • Purging CDN cache..."
gcloud compute backend-buckets update daa-landing --purge-cache
gcloud compute backend-buckets update daa-blog --purge-cache
gcloud compute backend-buckets update daa-enrollment --purge-cache
echo "    ✓ Cache purged"

# Step 3: Verify rollback
echo "  • Verifying rollback..."
STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://detroitautomationacademy.com)
echo "    Landing page status: $STATUS"

if [[ $STATUS == 200 ]]; then
  echo "✅ ROLLBACK COMPLETE"
