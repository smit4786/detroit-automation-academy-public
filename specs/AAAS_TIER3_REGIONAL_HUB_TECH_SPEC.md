# Technical Specification: AaaS Tier 3 Regional Hub ("The Engine")
**Owner:** @CTO & @Provost-Academy
**Status:** DRAFT - For Technical Review
**Deployment Tier:** Regional Authority (Scale: 500+ Nodes)

## 1. System Objective
To provide a decentralized, multi-tenant deployment of the Detroit Automation Academy curriculum and Oculus Agent Fleet. The Tier 3 Regional Hub serves as the central orchestration point for constituent school districts, providing instructor-side AI support and native mobile student telemetry.

## 2. Architectural Layers

### 2.1. Distribution Layer (AaaS Core)
- **Central Curriculum Registry:** A private Git-based repository serving high-fidelity Markdown and media assets for DAA Phases 1-3.
- **Tenant Management:** Multi-tenant PostgreSQL schema (integrated with `oculus_agent_schema.sql`) to track regional hub metadata, district sub-tenants, and instructor access tokens.

### 2.2. Agent Orchestration Layer (Fleet Access)
- **Hub-Specific Fleet:** Provisioning of dedicated agent instances (Academy-Instructor, Codebase-Auditor) per regional hub.
- **Remote Execution:** Secure, token-based API access to the local MCP server for regional lab hardware status updates and student project validation.

### 2.3. Data & Telemetry Layer
- **Unified Pulse Dashboard:** Real-time data aggregation of student progress and hardware health across all constituent districts.
- **Zero-Knowledge Sync:** CloudKit-based persistence for student profiles, ensuring PII is never exposed to the central distribution layer.

## 3. Hardware Integration Pipeline
- **Regional Hub "Box":** Standardized server node + regional instructor training kit.
- **Constituent Lab Nodes:** ESP32/Arduino-based robotics nodes that sync telemetry directly to the Hub's local MCP endpoint via Bluetooth or Secure MQTT.

## 4. Security & Compliance
- **OAuth 2.0 Integration:** Mandatory Google SSO or Oculus-Core biometric login for all instructors.
- **Data Sovereignty:** All student-generated code and PII remain within the Regional Hub's local encrypted storage (Local-First mandate).

## 5. Deployment Roadmap
- **Sprint 1:** Finalize Multi-tenant DB Schema.
- **Sprint 2:** Deploy "Academy-Instructor" remote API endpoint.
- **Sprint 3:** First regional pilot (Wayne County RESA).
