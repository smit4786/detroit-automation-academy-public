  # Use encryption for PHI storage
  from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
  
  key = Fernet.generate_key()
  cipher = Fernet(key)
  encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(b"PHI_data")
  ```

- [ ] **Encryption in Transit**
  - All API endpoints use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
  - No PHI transmitted over unencrypted channels

- [ ] **Access Control**
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
  - Least privilege principle applied

- [ ] **Audit Logging**

  audit_log = {
      "timestamp": "2026-01-27T12:00:00Z",
      "user_id": "user_123",
      "action": "financial_record_updated",
      "record_id": "rec_456",
      "old_value": {"amount": 1000},
      "new_value": {"amount": 2000},
      "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
      "status": "success"
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Change Management**
  - All code changes tracked in Git
  - Approval workflow for financial code
  - Automated test suite (regression prevention)
  - Separation of duties (dev/deploy)

- [ ] **Segregation of Duties**
  - Developers cannot deploy to production
  - Finance users cannot modify code
  - System administrators cannot change audit logs

- [ ] **Backup & Recovery**
