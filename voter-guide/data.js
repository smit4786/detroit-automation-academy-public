About $30 per year on a home with a $300,000 market value; Oakland County estimates about $16 million collected in the first year. The Authority's Articles of Incorporation — adopted by both county commissions in July 2026 — lock in the revenue split: 15% of each county's collections goes to that county for other public historical museums there (though either county may redirect its share to the two main museums); of the remainder, 60% to the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History and 40% to the Detroit Historical Museum and Dossin Great Lakes Museum. No millage revenue may pay for maintenance deferred before the Articles were adopted. The Authority must meet under the Open Meetings Act, comply with FOIA, and obtain an annual audit under government auditing standards; its museum contracts must include free general admission for county residents, free tours, programming and transportation for schools and seniors, and teacher curriculum support. If voters in either county reject the millage, the Authority dissolves. Official ballot language not yet published — verify the wording on your sample ballot before voting.",

Note: the Authority's adopted Articles now bind it to the Open Meetings Act, FOIA, and annual government-standard audits. The Oakland County Board approved the Articles 11-6 on July 16, 2026 (no votes: Commissioners Hoffman, Joliat, Long, Smiley, Spisz, Weipert).",
