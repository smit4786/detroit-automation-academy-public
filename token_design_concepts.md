# Commemorative Token Design Concepts

**Event:** Boys & Girls Club Grand Opening
**Purpose:** Swag for "Token Economy" activation & demonstration of rapid prototyping capabilities.

## Concept 1: The "Future Gear" (3D Printed)
*   **Description:** A 40mm diameter gear with 6 teeth generated via Python script.
*   **Material:** PLA (Silver or Gold silk filament).
*   **Fabrication:** Bambu Lab A1/X1.
*   **Print Time:** ~12 minutes.
*   **Learning Point:** Demonstrates "Code to CAD" – generating physical geometry from Python algorithms.

## Concept 2: The "Circuit Coin" (Laser Cut)
*   **Description:** A 35mm wooden disc. The surface is engraved with a stylized PCB (Printed Circuit Board) trace pattern. The edge is vector cut.
*   **Material:** 3mm Birch Plywood or Clear Acrylic.
*   **Fabrication:** Epilog Fusion Maker.
*   **Cut/Engrave Time:** ~2 minutes.
*   **Learning Point:** Demonstrates vector cutting vs. raster engraving.

## Concept 3: The "Detroit Skyline" Keychain (3D Printed)
*   **Description:** A rectangular tag (30mm x 50mm) featuring a low-poly relief of the Detroit skyline. Includes a hole for a keyring.
*   **Material:** Multi-color PLA (Black base, White relief) using the AMS system.
*   **Fabrication:** Bambu Lab X1 Carbon (Multi-material).
*   **Print Time:** ~20 minutes (longer due to color changes).
*   **Learning Point:** Showcases multi-color printing capabilities.

## Concept 4: The "Robot Head" (3D Printed)
*   **Description:** A flat, 2D-extruded icon of a friendly robot face. Simple geometry.
*   **Material:** Bright Blue or Green PLA.
*   **Fabrication:** Bambu Lab A1 (High speed mode).
*   **Print Time:** ~8 minutes.
*   **Learning Point:** Rapid manufacturing speed demonstration.

## Selected Design for Mass Production
*   **Recommendation:** **Concept 1 (The "Future Gear")**
    *   *Reasoning:* Fast to print, durable, tactile (fidget factor), and clearly relates to "Automation".
